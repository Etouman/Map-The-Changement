# South Korea Population Change 

Throughout the years, South Korea has maintained steady growth in the shipbuilding, consumer electronics and semiconductor sectors, driven by giants such as Samsung, Hyundai and LG. 
As a result, the development of activities in major urban areas has forced a massive exodus from rural areas to business, technology and industrial centers such as Seoul, Incheon and Busan. 
You can see how I realise a map showing population change in South Korea between 2000 and 2010.

# Douala Cameroon Population Change 
In some maps featuring the population change in many countries, I was truly captivated by the breathtaking beauty of this geographic repartition through the times and the modifications that can be occur based on technology development and industries development. To align with my recent motivation, I utilized the Douala population change data from GHSL between 1990 and 2020. It was an incredible experience that permit to emphasize the population change in neighbourhoods such as Kotto, Malangue, Logbessou and Ndogpassi.
